###### In case of trouble opening the jupyter notebook (rendering issue), use this link: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/animdas/Academic-Capstone-NBFC-Loan-Foreclosure/blob/main/Capstone%20-%20NBFC%20Loan%20Foreclosures.ipynb

Objective: This multifaceted assignment involved solving a real-world NBFC problem by conducting a thorough analysis of the various loan attributes, building a machine learning model to make predictions and providing recommendations to the NBFC from the insights generated in order to avoid foreclosure costs.

Tools/Techniques used: Python, Feature Engineering and Selection, Classifier Algorithms, Ensemble, Hyperparameter Optimization, Business Reporting/Recommendations.

Conclusion: The final ensemble model was able to predict foreclosures with great accuracy. Several recommendations were provided to the NBFC based on the insights generated from EDA, model feature importances etc., adopting which foreclosures costs can be avoided.
